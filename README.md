## Deviations
- We did not include ratings (1-5 bean scale) and tags based off of the user reviews because we will be working on the Coffee Connect and BrewLog in the next release which is where the users give their ratings. For now, we added placeholders for that information based on 
- We anticipated getting descriptions from the Yelp / Google API but it was paid or did not exist, so we had to manually add in the descriptions to Firestore as discussed with Professor Bulko.
As discussed with professor Bulko we changed the edit page, instead of it being a pop up for one field, users are able to change and update all the fields at once.
